Gwaldam is a small town itself, the main reason for its prosperity is its being a junction of Kumaon and Garhwal and many paths lead to different areas and villages.[citation needed] It is also a base camp for the trekkers who enter from Kathgodam railhead on trekking route to Lord Curzon Trail, Nanda Devi Raj Jat and Roopkund. Once it was a mandi for potato and apple trade.
