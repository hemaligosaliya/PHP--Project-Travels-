Bhimtal Lake has an island located within it, which once had a restaurant. However, the restaurant was closed down due to pollution issues and an aquarium was created in its place by the Nainital Lake Development Authority. 

Aquarium in Bhimtal is quite popular among tourists and specially kids love to visit this place.
