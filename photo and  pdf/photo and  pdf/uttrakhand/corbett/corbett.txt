Corbett National Park is in the Nainital and Pauri Garhwal districts of Uttaranchal. The park has retained its primeval character, where man must walk timidly, in awe of nature. Corbett, the first national park of India, was delimited in consultation with Jim Corbett, a great hunter and wildlife conserver. In 64 years of its history, the park has grown considerably. The park has three distinct seasons—summers from March to June, winters from November to February, and rain for rest of the year. The park is closed between June 15 to November 15 every.
